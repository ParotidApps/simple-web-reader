## Security Risks and Considerations

### 1. **OpenAI API Key**
- Users must provide their OpenAI API key in the **Settings** menu for word translation and definition.
- The key is stored locally in your browserâ€™s local storage for convenience.
- **Risk:** Your API key could be accessed by malicious browser extensions or other local threats.
  - **Recommendation:** Only use this app on trusted devices with no untrusted browser extensions.

### 2. **Local Storage**
- Text files, collected words, and progress data are saved in local storage for offline usage.
- **Risk:** Sensitive or personal data from `.txt` files could be accessible to anyone with access to your browser.
  - **Recommendation:** Avoid uploading private or sensitive `.txt` files.

### 3. **GitHub Hosting**
- The app is hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages.
- No data is sent to servers other than OpenAI's API (via HTTPS requests).
- **Risk:** Ensure the app URL is correct ([https://parotidapps.github.io/simple-web-reader/](https://parotidapps.github.io/simple-web-reader/)) to avoid phishing risks.

## Known Limitations

- Translation and definitions depend on the OpenAI API. You need an active OpenAI API subscription to use these features.
- Large `.txt` files exceeding ~1MB may not be stored in local storage due to browser limits.
